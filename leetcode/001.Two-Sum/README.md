# 1. Two Sum

Detail Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

Given an array of integers, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly** one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

## Example

```info
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

## What I learn

### Python3

- How the dict(dictionaries) work.
- How to use `enumerate` when looping through dictionaries
- How to do the python unit test
